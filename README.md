## 🙏 Inspiration

Made with love for my mom — who already knows every mantra by heart.  
This app helps me follow along, stay consistent, and log my daily practice.  
She can also add any special mantras she wants me to chant.

May it serve as a small digital bridge between devotion and discipline 💜
